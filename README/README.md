# Code Quiz

<strong> Name </strong>

the name of this app is <i>Code Quiz </i> as it is designed to evaluate user's coding skills.

<strong>Description</strong>

As a web developer, I want a deployed portfolio that can showcase my work to potential employers and clients. It is in that spirit that my instructor gave me and other students a homework 4 to design a web application that can evaluate user's coding skills then save the score in local storage everytime the user takes the quiz.

<strong>Programs used</strong>

I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, jquery and bootstrap library and of course Git/Github were used as version control.

<strong>Installation</strong>

This is only a website and does not need installation. it is currently hosted in github and you can access it at https://janviermbilizi.github.io/Code_Quiz/

<strong>Usage</strong>

The page is simple, clean, easy to use and undertand. It is like a game, it evaluates your coding skills everytime you play and saves your scores. When you go to the site, you will see instructions and a teal button <i>Start Quiz</i> to click in order to start the quiz. once clicked the quiz will start. Once you choose your answer, the next question wil pop up. When you finish all of the questions, your score will display alongside a form that will ask you to type your initials and save your score. Once saved, it will display your previous scores, if you played before along with all of your highestscores. From there, you will also see two buttons that allow you to go back and/or clear your scores. The top left of the site contains a link labeled "View Highscore" that allows you to see your previous scores, if you have taken the quiz before. see pictures below.
